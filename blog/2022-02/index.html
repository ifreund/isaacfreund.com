	<h1>February 2022 Status Update</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Hello again!
It&rsquo;s been nearly a month and a half since my last status update.
Since I hope to fall into a monthly rhythm with these this is a decent start, look for the next one around the middle of March.
I&rsquo;ve also gotten a proper <a href="https://isaacfreund.com/blog/feed.xml">Atom Feed</a> set up for this blog now for those of you using feed readers of some kind.</p>
<p>I spent a fair bit of time over the past month an a half working on a better screenlocking protocol for Wayland.
This resulted in the ext-session-lock-v1 protocol which was merged into the upstream <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/">wayland-protocols</a> repository three weeks ago.
This marks the first upstream Wayland protocol I have written and the first protocol in the ext- namespace to be accepted into wayland-protocols!</p>
<p>The ext-session-lock-v1 protocol makes it possible for lockscreens implemented outside of the Wayland compositor to be far more secure, compared to the status quo wlr-input-inhibitor-v1 plus wlr-layer-shell-v1 solution that has been used by <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock">swaylock</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ifreund/waylock">waylock</a> thus far.
Currently if, for example, swaylock crashes while the session is locked then the session will no longer be locked.
With ext-session-lock-v1, the session does not unlock if the client crashes.
Furthermore, hotplugging outputs is inherently racy with the current solution which means that a few frames of the unlocked session may be visible if a monitor is plugged in while the session is locked.
Again, with ext-session-lock-v1 this problem is solved.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://emersion.fr">Simon Ser</a> for the excellent code reviews of the protocol and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/merge_requests/3414">wlroots implementation</a>, as well as for <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock/pull/219">updating swaylock</a> to use ext-session-lock-v1.
I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/riverwm/river/pull/497">implemented</a> ext-session-lock-v1 for river but am waiting for the 0.16.0 wlroots release to merge it as river tracks the latest wlroots release not the master branch.
I&rsquo;ve also started rewriting <a href="https://github.com/ifreund/waylock">waylock</a> from the ground up in Zig with a much higher focus on security and benefiting from the experience I&rsquo;ve gained over the past 2 years of doing this stuff.
Until that work is complete I recommend using swaylock instead.</p>
<p>The goal of this work is to ensure, to the best of my ability, that <a href="https://www.jwz.org/">jwz</a> doesn&rsquo;t have to say <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2021/01/i-told-you-so-2021-edition/">&ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;</a> about screen locking on my Wayland compositor.
Once the security problem has been satisfactorily solved I want to explore making fun graphics possible without compromising security, but that may take me a long time to get around to.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/riverwm/river/releases/tag/v0.1.3">released</a> river 0.1.3 about a week ago.
It includes quite a few bug fixes, so if you&rsquo;re not yet using river 0.1.3 and wlroots 0.15.1 I&rsquo;d highly recommend upgrading.
I also decided to change river&rsquo;s license from GPL-3.0-or-later to GPL-3.0-only with this release,
primarily because I decided that I do not feel comfortable licensing software under a hypothetical future license version which is outside my control.
What if I disagree with the changes made?
I&rsquo;m happy with locking in on version 3 of the GPL for river as there&rsquo;s no real need to worry about the compatibility benefits of the &ldquo;or later&rdquo; clause as river is not a library.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, see you all in March!</p>
