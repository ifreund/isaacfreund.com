<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally done it. I&rsquo;ve taken the time to learn enough about web development
to set up my own blog. I may tweak the styling a little in the future, but I
think the bare bones look will never really be out of date.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> to build this site. It may seem a little
overkill for something so simple, but I find it quite easy to use despite its
power and it allows me to compose these posts in markdown.</p>
<p>It is not yet entirely clear to me how I will use this blog, however i am
glad that I now have the infrastructure in place should I have thoughts to
put into words.</p>
