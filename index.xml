      <description>In the spring of 2020 I found myself hooked on Wayland thanks to sway but increasingly frustrated with the i3 style window management sway implements. I tried several of the other more mature Wayland compositors including hikari and Wayfire but didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy them any more than sway. I wanted dynamic tiling window management similar to dwm but on Wayland and without dwm&amp;rsquo;s configuration through patching the source code approach.
As I had a newfound abundance of free time at home in front of my computer thanks to the global pandemic that was ramping up that spring, I decided to write my own Wayland compositor.</description>
