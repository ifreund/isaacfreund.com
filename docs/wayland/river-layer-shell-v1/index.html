support the wlr-layer-shell-v1 protocol.<p>The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
"should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.</div><h2>river_layer_shell_v1</h2><p>Version: 1<h3>destroy
-
destroy the river_layer_shell_v1 object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request indicates that the client will no longer use the
river_layer_shell_v1 object.</div><h3>get_output
-
get layer shell output state</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>It is a protocol error to make this request more than once for a given
river_output_v1 object.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>id<td>new_id<td><tr><td>output<td>object<td></table><h3>get_seat
-
get layer shell seat state</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>It is a protocol error to make this request more than once for a given
river_seat_v1 object.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>id<td>new_id<td><tr><td>seat<td>object<td></table><h2>river_layer_shell_output_v1</h2><p>Version: 1<h3>destroy
-
destroy the object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request indicates that the client will no longer use the
river_layer_shell_output_v1 object and that it may be safely destroyed.<p>This request should be made after the river_output_v1.removed event is
received to complete destruction of the output.</div><h3>set_default
-
Set default output for layer surfaces</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>Mark this output as the default for new layer surfaces which do not
request a specific output themselves. This request overrides any
previous set_default request on any river_layer_shell_output_v1 object.<p>If no set_default request is made or if the default output is destroyed,
the default output is undefined until the next set_default request.<p>This request modifies window management state and may only be made as
part of a manage sequence, see the river_window_manager_v1 description.</div><h3>non_exclusive_area
-
area left after subtracting exclusive zones</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This event indicates the area of the output remaining after subtracting
the exclusive zones of layer surfaces. Exclusive zones are a hint, the
window manager is free to ignore this area hint if it wishes.<p>The x and y values are in the global coordinate space, not relative to
the position of the output.<p>This event will be followed by a manage_start event after all other new
state has been sent by the server.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>x<td>int<td><tr><td>y<td>int<td><tr><td>width<td>int<td><tr><td>height<td>int<td></table><h2>river_layer_shell_seat_v1</h2><p>Version: 1<h3>destroy

destroy the object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request indicates that the client will no longer use the
river_layer_shell_seat_v1 object and that it may be safely destroyed.<p>This request should be made after the river_seat_v1.removed event is
received to complete destruction of the seat.</div><h3>focus_exclusive
-</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>A layer shell surface will be given exclusive keyboard focus at the end
of the manage sequence in which this event is sent. The window manager
may want to update window decorations or similar to indicate that no
window is focused.<p>Until the focus_non_exclusive or focus_none event is sent, all window
manager requests to change focus are ignored.<p>This event will be followed by a manage_start event after all other new
state has been sent by the server.</div><h3>focus_non_exclusive
-</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>A layer shell surface will be given non-exclusive keyboard focus at the
end of the manage sequence in which this event is sent. The window
manager may want to update window decorations or similar to indicate
that no window is focused.<p>The window manager continues to control focus and may choose to focus a
different window/shell surface at any time. If the window manager sets
focus during the same manage sequence in which this event is sent, the
layer surface will not be focused.<p>This event will be followed by a manage_start event after all other new
state has been sent by the server.</div><h3>focus_none
-</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>No layer shell surface will have keyboard focus at the end of the manage
sequence in which this event is sent. The window manager may want to
return focus to whichever window last had focus, for example.<p>This event will be followed by a manage_start event after all other new
state has been sent by the server.</div><p><div class=copyright><p><br>SPDX-FileCopyrightText: © 2025 Isaac Freund<br>SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to<br>deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the<br>rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or<br>sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
