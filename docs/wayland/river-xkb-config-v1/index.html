keyboard input devices. It also allows switching between the layouts of a
keymap and toggling capslock/numlock state.<p>The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
"should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.</div><h2>river_xkb_config_v1</h2><p>Version: 1<h3>stop
-
stop sending events</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request indicates that the client no longer wishes to receive
events on this object.<p>The Wayland protocol is asynchronous, which means the server may send
further events until the stop request is processed. The client must wait
for a river_xkb_config_v1.finished event before destroying this object.</div><h3>destroy
-
destroy the river_xkb_config_v1 object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request should be called after the finished event has been received
to complete destruction of the object.<p>It is a protocol error to make this request before the finished event
has been received.<p>If a client wishes to destroy this object it should send a
river_xkb_config_v1.stop request and wait for a
river_xkb_config_v1.finished event. Once the finished event is received
it is safe to destroy this object and any other objects created through
this interface.</div><h3>create_keymap
-
create a keymap object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>The server must be able to mmap the fd with MAP_PRIVATE.
The server will fstat the fd to obtain the size of the keymap.
The client must not modify the contents of the fd after making this request.
The client should seal the fd with fcntl.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>id<td>new_id<td><tr><td>fd<td>fd<td><tr><td>format<td>uint<td></table><h3>finished
-
the server has finished with the object</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This event indicates that the server will send no further events on this
object. The client should destroy the object. See
river_xkb_config_v1.destroy for more information.</div><h3>xkb_keyboard
-
new xkb keyboard</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>A new xkbcommon keyboard has been created. Not every
river_input_device_v1 is necessarily an xkbcommon keyboard as well.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>id<td>new_id<td></table><h2>river_xkb_keymap_v1</h2><p>Version: 1<h3>destroy
-
destroy the keymap object</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This request indicates that the client will no longer use the keymap
object and that it may be safely destroyed.</div><h3>success
-
keymap creation succeeded</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>The keymap object was successfully created and may be used with the
river_xkb_keyboard_v1.set_keymap request.</div><h3>failure
-
keymap creation failed</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>The compositor failed to create a keymap from the given parameters.<p>It is a protocol error to use this keymap object with

object and that it may be safely destroyed.</div><h3>set_keymap
-
set the keymap</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>Set the keymap for the keyboard.<p>It is a protocol error to pass a keymap object for which the

-
set the active layout by name</h3><p>Kind: Request,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>Set the active layout for the keyboard's keymap. Has no effect if there
is no layout with the give name for the keyboard's keymap.</div><table><tr><th>Argument<th>Type<th>Description<tr><td>name<td>string<td></table><h3>capslock_enable

-
the xkb keyboard is removed</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>This event indicates that the xkb keyboard has been removed.<p>The server will send no further events on this object and ignore any
request (other than river_xkb_keyboard_v1.destroy) made after this event

-
corresponding river input device</h3><p>Kind: Event,
Since Version: 1<div class=description><p>The river_input_device_v1 corresponding to this xkb keyboard. This event
